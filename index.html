                <pre>The month of Ramadan is the most important month of the year for Muslims,
                     in which Allah revealed the Holy Quran.

                    And its fasting is considered obligatory, 
                    it is one of the pillars of Islam, it is also mentioned in the Holy Quran.
                  
                  Allah has imposed the fasting of all the days of this month 
                  on all Muslims around the world who have physical ability
                  , from the dawn until the sunset of the same day.
                  
                  The month of Ramadan is of great religious significance,
                   in which the doors of fire are closed and the doors of Paradise open.
                  
                    Also the reward for â€˜Umrah in this month is multiplied by many times.</pre>
